# Diabetic Classifier via Machine Learning Models
This project aims to predict the likelihood of diabetes in individuals based on various health indicators using machine learning techniques.

# Overview
The goal of this project is to create a predictive model that can classify whether an individual has diabetes or not based on features such as glucose level, blood pressure, BMI, etc. The dataset used for training and evaluation contains a collection of health-related attributes. Varying models including KNN, Decision Trees and Logistic Regression were created and applied to the dataset. 

# Dependencies
- Python (version >= 3.6)
- NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn
